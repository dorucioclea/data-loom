            Avoid using public Wi-Fi or mobile data, as these networks might
            restrict peer-to-peer connections.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ensure that firewall settings or other network restrictions are not
            blocking the connection.
          </li>
          <li>
            If possible, connect both devices to the same Wi-Fi network. This
            often helps but is not required.
